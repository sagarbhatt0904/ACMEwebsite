# Overarching Statement Of The Research Objectives

Our three over-arching project research objectives are: 

(i) To enhance predictive capability for the relationship between independently controllable thermal and mechanical processing conditions and resultant microstructure in polycrystalline Ti-6Al-4V, by developing robust methods for integrating real-time observation and simulation of microstructural evolution as functions of thermomechanical trajectories,

(ii) To control microstructural evolution by regulating the temperature and strain history using model-based feed-forward control and measurement-based feedback control and model adaptation,

(iii) To develop methodologies to apply the knowledge learned in the microscale laboratory environment to macroscale industrial processes, where real-time micro-structural sensing is not available. This “meeting ground” will be macroscopic techniques which manufacturers employ in the development of their own process sequences. 

Ultimately, we believe this work can provide critical guidance to process designers enabling shorter material development cycles. 


# Statement of Intellectual Merit

While extensive effort has been devoted to the modeling and characterization of microstructure evolution during thermo-mechanical processing of metal alloys, a fully quantitative understanding that could be used to accurately predict microstructure evolution does not yet exist.   Nor do methods currently exist to dynamically intervene during materials processing to attain the particular microstructure necessary to meet material performance requirements. The aim of this project is to develop the understanding and methods necessary to interpret simulation and microstructural data, and then to apply the necessary control of materials processing conditions to generate a proscribed microstructure.  The primary test application will be control of microstructure of an advanced engineering alloy, Ti-6Al-4V, which possesses a complex inter-dependent set of relationships between grain microstructure and the predominant &alpha; and &beta; phase distributions.

The advances anticipated under this project are: 

(a) Development of integrated sensing-simulation-control methodologies for thermo-mechanical processing of an industrially relevant alloy, Ti-6Al-4V, based on the coupled relationships of grain and phase distributions,  
(b) Development of methods to scale microscale simulator methods to macroscopic samples of relevance to industrial metal manufacturing, 
(c) Working with industrial collaborators, demonstration of the ability to implement improved processing trajectories for materials and for manufactured parts.


# Statement of Broader Impact

This work can develop new adaptive process control methodologies that can be of significant competitive advantage to the US metals manufacturing industry.  We are also training the next-generation workforce to be versed in the integrated experiment-simulation-data approached epitomized by the [Materials Genome Initiative](https://www.mgi.gov/). Graduate and undergraduate student researchers involved in this project are exposed to an interdisciplinary set of engineering methodologies as well as exposure to industrial practice.  The graduate student researchers have created a set of outreach materials for an undergraduate pop-up course on “Better metal forming by linking experiment, modeling, and process control."
