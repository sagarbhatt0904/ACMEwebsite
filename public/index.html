            This work aims to develop methods to predict, monitor, and control microstructural evolution in real-time during thermomechanical 
		  processing of metals in order to optimize properties and reduce the time and cost to develop and adopt new materials in 
		  industrial applications.

	  <p>Our three over-arching project research objectives are: <br>
<br>
(i) To enhance predictive capability for the relationship between independently controllable thermal and mechanical 
		  processing conditions and resultant microstructure in polycrystalline Ti-6Al-4V, by developing robust 
		  methods for integrating real-time observation and simulation of microstructural evolution as functions 
		  of thermomechanical trajectories;<br>
<br>
(ii) To control microstructural evolution by regulating the temperature and strain history using model-based feed-forward 
		  control and measurement-based feedback control and model adaptation; and <br>
<br>
(iii) To develop methodologies to apply the knowledge learned in the microscale laboratory environment to macroscale 
		  industrial processes, where real-time micro-structural sensing is not available. This “meeting ground” 
		  will be macroscopic techniques which manufacturers employ in the development of their own process sequences. <br>
<br>
Ultimately, we believe this work can provide critical guidance to process designers enabling shorter material development cycles.

<h1 id="statement-of-intellectual-merit">Statement of Intellectual Merit</h1>
<p>While extensive effort has been devoted to the modeling and characterization of microstructure evolution during thermo-mechanical 
	processing of metal alloys, a fully quantitative understanding that could be used to accurately predict microstructure evolution 
	does not yet exist.   Nor do methods currently exist to dynamically intervene during materials processing to attain the 
	particular microstructure necessary to meet material performance requirements. The aim of this project is to develop the 
	understanding and methods necessary to interpret simulation and microstructural data, and then to apply the necessary control of 
	materials processing conditions to generate a proscribed microstructure.  The primary test application will be control of 
	microstructure of an advanced engineering alloy, Ti-6Al-4V, which possesses a complex inter-dependent set of relationships 
	between grain microstructure and the predominant &alpha; and &beta; phase distributions.<br>
	<br>
	The advances anticipated under this project are: <br>
	<br>
	(a) Development of integrated sensing-simulation-control methodologies for thermo-mechanical processing of an industrially 
	relevant alloy, Ti-6Al-4V, based on the coupled relationships of grain and phase distributions,  <br>
	
	(b) Development of methods to scale microscale simulator methods to macroscopic samples of relevance to industrial metal manufacturing, <br>
	
	(c) Working with industrial collaborators, demonstration of the ability to implement improved processing trajectories for materials and 
	for manufactured parts.  
</p>
	  
<h1 id="statement-of-broader-impact">Statement of Broader Impact</h1>
<p> This work can develop new adaptive process control methodologies that can be of significant competitive advantage to the US 
	metals manufacturing industry.  We are also training the next-generation workforce to be versed in the integrated 
	experiment-simulation-data approached epitomized by the <a href="https://www.mgi.gov/" target="_blank">Materials Genome Initiative</a>. 
	Graduate and undergraduate student researchers involved in this project are exposed to an interdisciplinary set of 
	engineering methodologies as well as exposure to industrial practice.  The graduate student researchers have created 
	a set of outreach materials for an undergraduate pop-up course on “Better metal forming by linking experiment, modeling, and process control.”
